## ViT Mice 🐭
ViT Mice are the mini-versions of the standard Vision Transformers.  Just as mice are often used in scientific experiments for their manageable size, our ViT Mice serve a similar purpose in the machine learning domain. By training these mice on both toy datasets and in-the-wild data, we aim to observe their behaviors in various environments.

**Categories of Mice** 
1. **Toy Data Mice:** Trained on controlled, synthetic datasets to understand specific behaviors or to isolate certain aspects of the learning process.
2. **In-the-Wild Mice:** Trained on naturalistic, real-world data reminiscent of models in-production.

**List of Mice** 

_To train_
* ImageNet-1k Mice
* Induction Mice
* Modular Arithmetic Mice
